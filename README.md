# Vocabulary-game
A desktop application made with the intention of helping new language-learners to repeat and check their vocabulary. This app is made for languages that I learn (English and German) but can be extended to other languages as well. You add new words with their translation in the app's database, then you can play the "game". The application will give random words from the specified language and the user needs to write the translation in his/her language. The app checks if the spelling is wrong and in case the user doesn't know the translation, it will show him the correct answer. The app keeps track of user's score.

# What I've Learned
- I've practice SQL commands using a local database (Insert, Delete, Select, Update, etc.)
- practiced working with Windows Forms (.NET Framework) (passing data between forms, working with UI, etc.)
This project was made with the intent of practicing my C# skills for a coding contest, and still make something useful for myself at the same time.
